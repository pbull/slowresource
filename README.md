slowresource
============

A Drupal module that simulates slow page loads via SQL queries and external HTTP requests.

This should be obvious, but DON'T USE THIS MODULE IN A REAL PRODUCTION SITE! The intention is to simulate a poorly performing site for example debugging and monitoring purposes. You should only install this module if you want to:

* test your monitoring tools
* demonstrate the use of debugging tools to isolate poorly performing code
* make your site perform like crap
